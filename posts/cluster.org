teaser: Kubernetes is certainly overkill as a deployment platform for personal projects, but once set up it's very convenient to use, and more importantly a great way to learn and experiment.

* Introduction
My main goal was the following: a kubernetes cluster running an nginx pod, running istio for traffic management, tracking metrics with prometheus and grafana, tracking logs with fluentd+elasticsearch+kibana, with sufficient log parsing that I could see request origin via geoIP in a may in Kibana.
* Provision resources
fix headers for etcd
* Install Istio
Gateway, scheduling on master via label, let traffic in via hostPath
* Setting up logging
the default kubernetes fluentd, es, kibana images: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/fluentd-elasticsearch
** viewing kibana
base url needed configuring to view it via proxy
** configuring fluentd
app crashed because "concat" plugin was being used in the configuration.
any non-trivial log handling that I needed from fluentd required plugins that weren't included, so I made
