* Introduction
Since adopting Emacs I've begun using [[https://orgmode.org/][org mode]] extensively for note-taking and personal organization. It's a natural choice for outlining an article or blog post, and what's more, [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Hakyll]] (using [[https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/][Pandoc]]) will compile org files just as readily as it will markdown--no configuration required.
* Features
Org markup is too rich to be completely converted to html, but a respectable subset is. Simple things like *bold*, _underline_ and /italic/ are of course supported. Here are some other examples:
** Subheadings
Pandoc will support up to sub-sub-headings, but no more.
*** Subsubheading one
He doesn't have much to say.
*** Subsubheading two
** Lists
This is an unordered list:
- this is a list
- another element
- another element

Ordered lists are also handled properly:
1. First
2. Second
3. Third

It also supports this format with items and inset information underneath:
- Some Item :: Information abouth this item is expanded upon.
- Other Item :: Here is some other information relating to the second item.
** Source
Wouldn't it be interesting to see some source? You can do inline code =echo "like this"=, and also separate code blocks:
#+BEGIN_SRC haskell
factorial :: Int -> Int
factorial 0 = 1
factorial n = n * factorial (n - 1)
#+END_SRC
Org mode is smart enough to correctly highlight the code-block in org-mode itself, so you don't publish embarassing typos. Just one more thing to be impressed by.
** Quote
This is a quote:
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
Everything should be made as simple as possible,
but not any simpler ---Albert Einstein
#+END_QUOTE
** Table

My CSS may not do this justice, but this a proper table.
| A | B | Long C Column | D |
|---+---+---------------+---|
| 1 | 2 |             3 |4  |

I remember back in the day when you would create your whole page layout with these bad boys. Then these upstarts named "divs" came along...

* In sum
Org mode is no more convenient to write than markdown; it's edge is that it allows you to write a rough sketch and then slowly flesh it out into a finished article. Anything that lowers the barrier to producing finished articles is valueable in my estimation.
