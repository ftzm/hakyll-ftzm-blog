* TypeSpeed
TypeSpeed is a simple webapp written as an exercise in learning Elm. A randomly selected sentence slides across the screen as you type, with speed and accuracy statistics displayed afterwards.
* Hnefatafl
Hnefatafl is the name of an old norse boardgame, like a cross between chess and go. I wrote Haskell engine for the game which includes a command line interface and a passable AI.
* The Kubernetes cluster this is running on.
Some would say that Kubernetes is overkill as a platform for a static blog and a few tiny webapps, and they'd be right. Still, it's great to have a place to experiment with the latest and greatest tools and techniques.
