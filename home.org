* Functional DevOps
My name is *Matthew Fitzsimmons*. I do cloud infrastructure and CI/CD tooling at [[https://www.tempo.io][Tempo]].

I do everything from repository and build management to Kubernetes cluster provisioning to incident response. I'm just likely to be writing developer tooling in Python as I am to be debugging production.

Declarative beats imperative. That's why I'm such a fan of Kubernetes' declarative state management, and first choice for infrastructure management is Terraform. My laptop runs on the declarative configs of NixOS.

My day job revolves around infrastructure, but I also find time to write software. My main focus is Haskell, but I also write Elm, Python, and more. You can see my projects here.

This website is a repository of solutions for myself and others, a place to share musings on devops and programming, and a playground to test out new tools and ideas.
